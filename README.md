St. Elizabethâ€™s west campus is composed of numerous historic buildings that need repair and rehabilitation. We (the client) purchased the Center Building and are now in the process of developing a master plan that includes rehabilitation options for a portion of the building, the Center Building (Buildings 1 and 2). We understand and are sympathetic to the character-defining properties of the building; but plan to use this space for office and would like a more open floor plan. The existing structural system includes the following:

Existing Gravity-Load-Resisting-System

1. Foundations/WallsAssignment Project Exam Help

Granite footings beneath load-bearing brick masonry walls

Exterior load-bearing, brick walls vary in width from 3 wythes to 5 wythes at the foundation

2. Floor Systems

First Floor Framing: solid-sawn wood joists, load bearing masonry walls

Typical Floor (Floors 2 through 4): solid-sawn wood joists, load bearing masonry walls

3. Roof Systems

Roof over wings (A/B and D/E): solid-sawn wood rafters

Roof over center (C): wood and steel trusses and solid-sawn wood purlins

Existing Lateral-Load Resisting System

1. Vertical Elements: unreinforced brick masonry shear walls

2. Horizontal Diaphragms

Floor diaphragms: typical floors: wood decking (existing sheathing or new plywood), gymnasium: existing concrete slab on metal deck

Roof diaphragms: typical roofs: wood decking (existing sheathing or new plywood) Diaphragm connectors: wood decking nailed to wood framing Some chord/collector elements are missing.

Final Project

The two schemes we would like you to pursue are as follows:

Scheme 1 â€“ Preservation

â€¢ Evaluate existing structural system with limited modifications â€¢ Repair and reinforce as necessary to satisfy design criteria.

Scheme 2 â€“ FaÃ§ade Retention with New Structure for Open Plan

â€¢ New concrete structural system within existing envelope (you pick floor system and if you will be providing new vertical structural system or supporting it on existing brick masonry walls).

We would like you to prepare a report, concept repair drawings and an outline specification that includes addresses the following components:

â€¢ General Description of Project

â€¢ Scope of Work, including rehabilitation concepts

â€¢ Referenced Building Codes and Standards

â€¢ Load Criteria (Dead, Live, Wind, and Seismic)

â€¢ Design Properties of Materials

3. Show calculations for the dead, wind, and seismic loads. Remember to check components and cladding too.

4. Review relevant building codes (IEBC 2012 and IBC 2012) as required to confirm the design implications.

5. Provide a summary of the architectural features including the windows and roof systems to confirm how you will reuse or replace these systems (in kind or with new materials).

6. Prepare a foundation, typical floor and roof framing plans andand a typical elevation. Include typical details as needed to show the design intent. Develope an outline specification to show the materials and general scope of work.

7. Summarize your recommendations for the structural strengthening and new concrete systems considering costs. Use R.S. MEANS or contractor contacts to gather supporting cost information toprepare a rough orderâ€“of-magnitude cost estimate for each option.
